    "## Regression Analysis with a Regression Loss Function\n",
    "Regression analysis predicts a continuous output variable based on the value of one or more input variables. Briefly, the goal of regression model is to build a mathematical approximation that defines the output variable as a function of the input variables. An example of a continuous variable is: the predicted price of a home based on inputs such as living space, number of rooms, etc. Note, the output is a continuous value, not a discrete value or a categorical value. The input variable can be continuous ro discrete.\n",

    "The loss fucntion associated with regression analysis is known as the regression loss. Mean Square Error (MSE) is the most commonly used regression loss function (as we'll illustrate that here with an example). MSE is the sum of squared distances between the target variable and predicted values.\n",

To learn (update model parameters), we back-propagate the loss, and that is done by taking the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the weights.
