    "## Regression Analysis with a Regression Loss Function\n",
    "Regression analysis predicts a continuous output variable based on the values of one or more input variables. Briefly, the goal of a regression model is to build a mathematical approximation that defines the output variable as a function of the input variables. An example of a continuous variable is the predicted price of a home based on inputs such as living space, number of rooms, etc. Note, the output is a continuous value, not a discrete value or a categorical value. The input variable can be continuous or discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss fucntion associated with regression analysis is known as the regression loss. Mean Square Error (MSE) is the most commonly used regression loss function (and we'll illustrate that here with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE is calculated as the mean of squared difference between predictions and actual observations (also know as the target). Expressed as a computation, it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sum( square( predicted_vals - targets ) ) / (number of training samples)` and you'll see it expressed as PyTorch code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the squaring of the error term means that larger deviations from the target values amplify the error way more than than smaller deviations, meaning that the model is penalized in a square relationship for deviating from the target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of MSE is that a few (or even one) outlier data points can make the loss unnecessarily large and that maynot be desirable since the squared outlier data point is penalizing the entire mean calculation. \n"

    "The Cross Entropy Loss function also has the benefit of learning at a faster pace. To learn (the process of continously updating model parameters), we back-propagate the loss, and that is done by taking the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the weights. In doing so, we can show that the rate at which the model parameters (weights and biases) learn is proportional to `output - target`, i.e., proportional to the error in the output. The larger the error, the faster the model will learn which is a very nice property.\n",
